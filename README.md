# My First Portfolio

## Description

This is a note taking application. It can add notes and delete notes and views olds ones. 

## Instructions
You will land on the index.html and just by clicking the get started button will lead you to notes page where you can start to write your own notes! You can also view old ones by clicking on them on the left hand side but sadly you can't edit them. Still a good application. Can also be used on any computer aslong as you have the link! :)
